Widgets are components that can be added, moved, and deleted from the home page, and they can be of different types, such as charts, tables, etc.

To add or remove Widgets, you must click on the "Change Widgets" button at the top right of the home page.

To move or resize a Widget, you must click on the "Edit Mode" button at the top right of the home page.

This will make the Widgets movable but you will not be able to interact with them. To interact with the Widgets again, you must click on the "View Mode" button at the top right of the home page.

There is no limit to the number of Widgets that can be added to the home page, however, it is recommended not to add too many Widgets to keep the home page clean and easy to read.

Widgets are independent for each company you have access to and vary according to the user's permissions.
