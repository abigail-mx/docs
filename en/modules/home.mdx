The home page serves as a quick glance at your company's information. This page is fully customizable through Widgets.

Widgets are components that can be added, moved, and removed from the home page. Widgets can be of different types, such as charts, lists, etc.

This page is independent for each company you have access to, and the widgets vary according to user permissions.

To add or remove widgets, click on the "Change Widgets" button at the top right of the home page.

To move or resize a Widget, click on the "Edit Mode" button at the top right of the home page. This will make the widgets movable but non-interactive. To return to interacting with the widgets, click on the "View Mode" button at the top right of the home page.

There is no limit to the number of widgets that can be added to the home page; however, it is recommended not to add too many widgets to keep the home page clean and easy to read.

Widgets are independent for each company you have access to and vary according to user permissions.

The order and size of widgets are independent for each type of device, meaning that changing the widget order on a mobile device will not affect the widget order on a desktop device. There are 3 device sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop.

If a user loses access to a module, the Widget will disappear from the home page.
