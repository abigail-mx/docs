## Inventory Management

Inventory varies by product and is independent across warehouses. There are three ways to modify inventory:

1. **Manual:**
   - Go to the warehouse page and adjust the inventory manually.

2. **Automatically by Sale:**
   - When a sale is recorded in the **Sales** module, the inventory of the sold products is automatically reduced.

3. **Automatically by Purchase:**
   - When a purchase from a supplier is marked as "Delivered" in the **Purchases** or **Supplier Orders** module, the inventory of the purchased products is automatically increased.
