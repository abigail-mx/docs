# Users: Employee and Administrator Management

To view users, you need access to the **Users** module.

## Navigation and Access

Find the **Users** section in the navigation bar and click on it.

Once in this module, you will see three sections:

1. **Active Users List:**
   - Displays all active users in the company.
   - You can search by first and last name.
   - You can deactivate users by clicking the trash button.

2. **Pending Invitations:**
   - Displays pending invitations sent via email.
   - If the employee already has an account, they only need to log in and accept the invitation.
   - You can delete invitations by clicking the trash button.
   - The sent email cannot be deleted, but the user will not be able to accept or reject the invitation when they log in.

3. **Invitation Form:**
   - Enter your employees' email addresses and the role they will have upon accepting the invitation.
   - If you want to change the assigned role, delete the invitation from the second section and re-invite the user with the new role.
   - By pressing **Add**, an entry is enabled to invite a user, and you can add more if you wish.
   - By clicking **Invite**, an email will be sent to the users with a link to create their account and accept the invitation.
