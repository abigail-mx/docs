# Accounts Payable: Managing Outstanding Accounts

To view accounts payable, you need access to the **Accounts Payable** module.

## Navigation and Access

1. **Access the Accounts Payable Module:**
   - In the navigation bar, find and click on the **Accounts Payable** section.

## Module Information

The Accounts Payable module helps you keep track of outstanding accounts with your suppliers.

### Overview

1. **Accounts Payable List:**
   - On the main screen, you will see a list of accounts payable, including:
     - Supplier name
     - Payment due date
     - Remaining amount
   - You will also find a bar chart breaking down accounts by month.

### Creating and Managing Accounts

1. **Creating Accounts Payable:**
   - You cannot add accounts payable directly from this section.
   - To create a new account payable, make a purchase from a supplier in the **Purchases** module, selecting the payment status as "Pending" or "Partial" and completing the required information.

2. **Managing Accounts:**
   - When viewing the details of an accounts payable, you can adjust the paid amount to keep track of payments. This payment will be recorded in the **Expenses** module as "Payment to Supplier".
   - Example: If you make a purchase of merchandise for $1000 and make a partial payment of $500, an accounts payable of $500 will be created along with a record in expenses as "Purchase of Merchandise". If you later pay $700, a new record will be created as "Payment to Supplier" for the remaining $200.

   />

3. **Status Changes:**
   - If you change the status of the account to "Paid", the payment will be recorded in expenses as "Payment to Supplier" for the remaining amount. For example, if the total amount was $1200 and $500 was already paid, changing the status to "Paid" will register a payment of $700.

When the paid amount equals or exceeds the total amount of the account and/or the payment status is "Paid", the accounts payable will be automatically removed from the system.
