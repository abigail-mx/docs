# Accounts Receivable: Managing Outstanding Accounts

To view accounts receivable, you need access to the **Accounts Receivable** module.

## Navigation and Access

1. **Access the Accounts Receivable Module:**
   - In the navigation bar, find and click on the **Accounts Receivable** section.

## Module Information

This module helps you keep track of outstanding accounts with your clients.

### Overview

1. **Accounts Receivable List:**
   - On the main screen, you will see a list of accounts receivable, including:
     - Client name
     - Payment due date
     - Remaining amount
   - You will also find a bar chart breaking down accounts by month.

### Creating and Managing Accounts

1. **Creating Accounts Receivable:**
   - You cannot add accounts receivable directly from this section.
   - To create a new account receivable, make a sale to a client in the **Sales** module, selecting the payment status as "Pending" or "Partial" and filling out the required information.

2. **Managing Accounts:**
   - When viewing the details of an accounts receivable, you can adjust the paid amount to keep track of payments. This payment will be recorded in the **Sales** module as "Customer Payment".
   - Example: If you make a sale of merchandise for $1000 and receive a partial payment of $500, an accounts receivable for $500 will be created along with a revenue record as "Sale of Merchandise". If you later pay $700, a new record will be created as "Customer Payment" for the remaining $200.

   />

3. **Status Changes:**
   - If you change the status of the account to "Paid", the payment will be recorded in revenues as "Client Payment" for the remaining amount. For example, if the total amount was $1200 and $500 was already paid, changing the status to "Paid" will register a payment of $700.

   />

When the paid amount equals or exceeds the total amount of the account and/or the payment status is "Paid", the accounts receivable will be automatically removed from the system.
